The next story is: Something’s missing in Brian Daboll’s explanation for Giants turning to Jaxson Dart - New York Post. One of the favorite buzzwords of the Joe Schoen and Brian Daboll regime was conspicuously missing Wednesday from the explanation by the Giants for benching Russell Wilson in favor of rookie Jaxson Dart. “It’s my decision,” Daboll said before practice. “We’re going with Jaxson. We’re going to get him ready to play this week and for the remainder of the season.” Access the Giants like never before Get texts from Paul Schwartz with all the latest Giants news and insights, exclusive to Sports+ subscribers. tRY IT NOW What happened to the “collaborative” decision-making process? What was the deliberation like with Schoen and owner John Mara? “That’s the direction I wanted to go, and that’s the direction we’re going to go,” Daboll said. “There are good conversations we had. Those are private, but ultimately it comes down to me.” Minutes after the Giants traded up to draft Dart with the No. 25 pick on April 24, Daboll called his rookie quarterback to say, “I’m banking on you.” Dart replied: “Smart man.” The test scores start counting Sunday against the undefeated Chargers, when Dart tries to rescue Daboll from the hot seat that a 1-13 record over his past 14 games (0-3 this season) has created. Wins will matter, but Dart’s trajectory of development under Daboll’s watch could take precedence. “When you know that your coach has confidence in you it means a lot because you know that you can trust them and they can trust you,” Dart said. “I know that every day I come out here, every day that I step into the facility, he’s going to give his all for me, and I’m going to do it the exact same way.

Wilson expected to get longer than a three-game runway when he signed in free agency to be the starter and took almost every first-team rep during training camp, but two offensive stinkers sandwiched around a 450-yard passing explosion and an abysmal 2-for-10 red-zone touchdown rate created a sense of urgency. “I don’t think any rookie quarterback is ever just ready to play,” Daboll said. “You put him in there because you think that he’s done enough to show you that he can go out there and compete. And he’s done that every step of the way. That’s why I made the decision.” 3 Jaxson Dart at Giants practice on Sept. 24, 2025. Noah K. Murray-NY Post Dart’s lack of chemistry-building work with the starters since the spring began means a lot of extra meetings are required this week. “I’m ready,” Dart said. “You always try to say, ‘I’m going to prepare the same each week.’ But in all reality, you have different responsibilities as the starter, so I’m just locked in.” A “humbled” and “thankful” Dart’s ability to quiet outside noise will be imperative. But he did take a moment Tuesday to FaceTime his mom after sharing the news with his father, in town for a visit. Not only could Dart be playing to save Daboll’s job, but he is
