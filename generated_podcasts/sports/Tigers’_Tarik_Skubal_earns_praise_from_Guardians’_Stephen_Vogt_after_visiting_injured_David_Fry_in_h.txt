The next story is: Tigers’ Tarik Skubal earns praise from Guardians’ Stephen Vogt after visiting injured David Fry in hospital - Cleveland.com. Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Tarik Skubal wipes his face after giving up three Cleveland Guardians’ runs in the sixth inning at Progressive Field. John Kuntz, cleveland.com CLEVELAND, Ohio — Stephen Vogt’s second season as a big-league manager has already been marked by plenty of challenges, but on Tuesday night he added a new line to his résumé: chauffeur. After David Fry was struck in the face by a 99 mph fastball from Tarik Skubal, suffering multiple facial fractures and spending the night at Cleveland Clinic, Vogt drove the Cy Young Award winning Detroit ace across town so he could visit Fry in person.

And that just speaks to, yes, we’re competing, yes, it’s important when we’re out on the field. But some things are bigger than baseball.” Skubal explained how the visit came together. “I got (Fry’s) number and then reached out,” he said. “I just assumed he didn’t have his phone — that they took him right from the field, right to the hospital. But I got in touch with (Vogt) and he took me over to the hospital. I was able to get in and see him and just apologize. Obviously nothing intentional, but still apologize about the situation. It’s one of those freak baseball plays. But I’m glad he was doing relatively all right.” Skubal added that Fry responded the next morning with a text message: “Thanks for coming. Meant a lot.” That was not Skubal’s motivation for going, but the message was reassuring. “This is a game, but we’re all humans, and (stuff) like that happens,” Skubal said. “That’s real life stuff, not baseball game stuff.” For Vogt, the frightening moment underscored just how little time hitters have against an arm like Skubal’s. “When you square around a bunt and with the way Skubal’s (arm) angle is, you can’t see it right out of the hand,” Vogt said. “You’ve got 99 coming right at your face … He threw a fastball and it just happened to be right at him and there was nothing he could do.” Fortunately for Cleveland, the news on Fry was encouraging. “David’s home now,” Vogt said. “He’s in great spirits. When I saw him last night, he was joking around. Normal David Fry personality. He’s a tough, tough kid. He’s injured, he’s hurting, he’s in a ton of pain, but as far as life goes, he’s going to be OK. Broken bones heal.” Skubal, who first met Fry at the All-Star Game in Texas, said the chance to check in with him deepened his respect. “That whole crew that they brought, they had six guys there and you could kind of tell they’re a tight-knit family, kind of like how we are,” Skubal said. “From what I’ve heard across the way, he’s kind of a leader in that clubhouse and a guy that everyone roots for. His story is pretty cool — not a high pick, grinded his way up, became an All-Star early in his career. Unfortunately, through this circumstance I’ll probably get to know him a little bit better, which might be a positive to bring out of this." Skubal added that the whole incident also deepened his respect for Vogt, his impromptu Uber driver for the night. “Also the way they play baseball and the team that they are,” Skubal said. “That speaks volumes about who they
