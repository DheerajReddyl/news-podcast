Our next story is titled: Seahawks get back key pieces of secondary for Cardinals game - Field Gulls. Julian Love and Devon Witherspoon are off the injury report and will play. Nick Emmanwori, however, is unlikely to play after spraining his ankle early in the 49ers game. Zach Charbonnet seemingly has a shot to play, while Boye Mafe and Anthony Bradford are names to watch when inactives are revealed 90 minutes before Thursdayâ€™s kickoff. The only Seahawk ruled out is swing tackle Josh Jones, who hurt his ankle toward the end of the Saints game. And that concludes this report.
