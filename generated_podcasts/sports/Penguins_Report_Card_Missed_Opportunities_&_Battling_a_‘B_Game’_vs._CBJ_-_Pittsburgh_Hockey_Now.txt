(Photo by Nick Wosika/Icon Sportswire) COLUMBUS — With Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas and assistant GM Jason Spezza perched above the ice in the management box, the young Penguins players had a chance to make a strong impression on the bosses who will decide their hockey fates in a couple of weeks. They had a chance to impress, but few did so in the Penguins’ 4-1 loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena. The Penguins took seven minor penalties, including shortly bunched minors midway through the third period by Connor Clifton and Connor Dewar, which afforded Columbus a two-man advantage and the insurance goal scored by Kent Johnson. It was a choppy game that lacked offensive surges, though Penguins coach Dan Muse didn’t seem too displeased. “I think it took us a little while. I actually thought it was after that, it was our first penalty kill, and then we gained some momentum,” Muse said. “And then I actually thought we really started to put together some shifts. So maybe a little bit at the very beginning of the period (we had trouble getting it going), but then I did think once we got a little momentum, we were able to carry it for a while. And it leads to scoring a goal and some other good O-zone shifts.” However, the game was not the special sort of energetic exposition that took place in Montreal on Monday in Game 1 of the Penguins ‘ seven-game preseason. Actually, it was quite the opposite, as the shots settled 25-24 for the Columbus Blue Jackets despite a late surge by the Penguins, whose only goal was by McGill University forward Zach Gallant (on an AHL deal). Gallant’s goal was soon whitewashed by a long-range softy, which Penguins goalie Arturs Silovs allowed to Yegor Chinakov from at least 40 feet. Soft goals from a long distance have been the knock on Silovs, and that gremlin was present again on Wednesday. Silovs allowed another miler to sneak past him midway through the second period, shortly before he swapped with Filip Larsson in a scheduled goalie change. Silovs made some good saves on scoring chances near the net, but was beaten twice from areas just short of Zanesville. Larsson also allowed one goal on 10 shots. Columbus goalie Jet Greaves played the entire game. The Penguins were being outshot 14-6 at the time of the goalie change. No, excitement was not a key component of the contest unless you were counting along with how many times scorers changed the shots total (hint: a lot). The Penguins took most of the second period before they found some of that energy, too. Aidan McDonaugh was the leading Penguins shooter with three shots on goal after 40 minutes. However, the Penguins had only three high-danger chances, while allowing two, according to NaturalStatTrick.com. Make no mistake, sometimes the most pressing analysis is not who played well, but a collage of players who needed to play well but were otherwise caught in the muck and mire of the game.
