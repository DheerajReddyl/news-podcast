The next story is: Reprogramming neuroblastoma by diet-enhanced polyamine depletion - Nature. Primary neuroblastoma patient samples Flash-frozen primary neuroblastoma tumour samples were provided by the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) under study number ANBL16B2 Q. International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification histologic parameters, MYCN amplification status, age and stage for every patient was obtained centrally via the COG Statistics and Data Center. Tumour cell content of samples was confirmed over 80% percent. Patient and tumour characteristics are given in Supplementary Table 1. Water-soluble metabolites were extracted and analysed as described below. Mouse models Animal studies followed protocols approved by Princeton University and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. For xenografts used for metabolomics, cancer cell lines were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.01% insulin/transferrin solution. Cell lines were provided by the COG Cell Culture Repository: LA-N-5, SMS-SAN, CHLA-90 and SK-N-SH. All cell lines repeatedly tested negative for Mycoplasma. Subcutaneous xenografts were established on 6-week-old female CD1-nu mice by injection of 100 μl 50/50 RPMI/Matrigel solution containing 106 cells of the respective cell line. For xenografts used in therapeutic trials, tumours were established on 4- to 6-week-old female NCr-nu mice (Charles River) by injection of 100 μl 50/50 RPMI/Matrigel solution containing 3 × 106 IMR5 cells (MYCN amplified, ALK amplified). Mice were randomized to specific treatment when tumours were ≥200 mm3. Mice were sacrificed when tumours were 2,000 mm3. Tumour mass was inferred using tumour volume using volume to mass of xenograft conversion described in McLean et al.58. The Th-MYCN mouse model was used to investigate the functional changes of metabolism driven by MYCN. 129×1/SvJ mice transgenic for the Th-MYCN construct10 were originally obtained from B. Weiss. Th-MYCN hemizygous mice were bred and litters randomized to assigned therapy. Mice were genotyped from tail-snip-isolated DNA using quantitative PCR23 and only transgene-homozygous mice (Th-MYCN+/+) were included in these studies. In this model, MYCN expression is targeted to the mouse neural crest under the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter, recapitulating hallmark features of human neuroblastoma. Tumours arise at autochthonous sites in an immunocompetent host with histologic, genomic, and immune similarities to human neuroblastoma59,60. Tumours are fully penetrant with onset prior to day 14 in >75% based on histologic audits61 and are lethal by 7 weeks. Mouse husbandry Mice were maintained with 12 h of dark daily (18:00 to 06:00). The rodent holding rooms were maintained at a temperature range of 18.9 °C–25.6 °C with an ideal setpoint of 22.2 °C. The humidity was maintained within a range of 30–70% with an ideal setpoint of 50%. Metabolite extraction from tissue, tumours and serum Tissues and tumours were collected from mice in fed state and immediately clamped into liquid nitrogen using Wollenberger clamp. All tissues were stored in −80 °C. Frozen tissues were transferred to 2 ml Eppendorf tubes, which were precooled on dry ice, and then pulverized using Cyromill. The resulting tissue powder was weighed (around 10 mg) and mixed well by vortexing in extraction buffer (40 μl extraction buffer per mg tissue). The extraction solution was neutralized with NH 4 HCO 3 as above and centrifuged in a microfuge at maximum speed for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was transferred to LC–MS vials for analysis. Blood samples were drawn from mouse tail veins using a microvette and kept on ice. After centrifugation (10 min, benchtop microfuge maximum speed, 4 °C), serum was collected in a 1.5 ml tube and stored at −80 °C. Five microlitres of serum were mixed with 200 μl extraction buffer (40:40:20 acetonitrile: methanol: water with 0.5% formic acid) and neutralized with 15% NH 4 HCO 3 . After centrifugation (30 min, benchtop microfuge maximum speed, 4 °C), supernatant was
