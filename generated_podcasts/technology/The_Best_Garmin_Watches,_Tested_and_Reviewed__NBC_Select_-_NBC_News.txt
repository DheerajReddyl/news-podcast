The next story is: The Best Garmin Watches, Tested and Reviewed | NBC Select - NBC News. Garmin makes a lot of different watches. While brands like Apple, Google and Samsung have two or three smartwatches to choose from, Garmin has dozens, which can make it hard to know which one is right for you. As NBC Select’s fitness and tech reporter, I test out smartwatches, fitness trackers and smart rings regularly: that includes all of Garmin’s latest watches. Below are my top recommendations for anyone looking to make the switch or upgrade an older model. How I test Garmin watches I typically wear two watches at the same time (one on each wrist) and compare data between the two. (I don’t typically wear four, as pictured above.) Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz I am a runner and cyclist, and use smartwatches and fitness trackers to track and monitor live stats like heart rate, pace and time as well as recovery metrics over time. I tend to spend hours tinkering with device settings, exploring what a product offers out of the box, and what I can fine-tune to match my preferences. I test Garmin watches for at least a week, using as many features as possible, usually comparing them (and the data) to another watch (on my other wrist) or smart ring. I’ve tested nearly a dozen Garmin watches over the years. I request Garmin watches from the brand — it sends me devices to test out as needed. I send each one back to the brand once I am done testing. Want more from NBC Select? Sign up for our newsletter, The Selection, and shop smarter. The best Garmin watches in 2025 Because Garmin makes so many different watches, it probably makes one that is just right for you. Below are my top recommendations. Best overall The Garmin Vivoactive 6 has a subtle and understated look, but still contains many of the brand's best features. Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz The Garmin Vivoactive 6 hits just the right balance of features and price that makes it the easiest option to recommend, especially for someone trying out the brand for the first time. It’s a generalist smartwatch: it has many of the brand’s best features without specializing too heavily in one activity (like the Forerunner series). It has in-depth metrics for health, sleep and fitness activity, with staple Garmin features like Body Battery, workout recovery times, Garmin Pace Pro and Garmin Coach (with running and strength training plans). I love its workout animations — the watch will play short videos of a silhouette performing certain exercises during HIIT, cardio, strength, yoga or move alert activity. Animated move alerts, in particular, make taking breaks at my desk a lot more fun. The upgrade: Garmin Venu 4 The budget alternative: n/a Best for runners I tested the Garmin Forerunner 265s — a smaller version of the regular 265. Courtesy Harry Rabinowitz Anyone who loves to run should look at the Garmin Forerunner series — they’re made with runners in mind. The Forerunner 265, despite newer options, is still my go-to recommendation: it has more than enough tools for runners and racers without costing nearly as much as newer models like the Forerunner 570 and 970. The most important features in my mind are Training Readiness, Training Status and HRV (heart rate variability) Status, which work in tandem to help optimize your training and recovery. Training Readiness combines multiple metrics to give you a top-level score about how beneficial your training will be. In practice, it helps me decide whether today is a rest day, an easy day or a day to push myself. It has advanced running metrics like power, cadence, stride length
