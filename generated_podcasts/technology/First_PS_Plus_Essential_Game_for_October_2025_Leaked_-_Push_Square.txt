Sony is scheduled to confirm next monthâ€™s lineup next Wednesday, instead of today. In recent livestreams, Sony has announced PS Plus titles during a State of Play, so there's a good chance the addition will be made official tonight.

In our Alan Wake2 PS5 review, we concluded: "With stunning visuals, pitch-perfect tone and atmosphere, brilliant pacing, and a fascinating mystery to sink your teeth into, there are no twists or turns about it" And that concludes this report.
