The next story is: Here's everything announced in PlayStation's latest State of Play showcase - Eurogamer. Well here we are again! Sony's returned with another PlayStation State of Play showcase, this one of an autumnal hue, meaning a fresh parade of announcements for things you'll be playing on your PS5 soon, soonish, and decidedly less soon. Official pre-show chatter confirmed we should expect a first in-depth look at Returnal studio Housemarque's latest PlayStation exclusive Saros, while rumblings elsewhere suggested a release date reveal for Nioh 3. But with proceedings now over, here's everything actually revealed during the show. Saros gets first gameplay and a release date And speaking of Housemarque's Returnal follow-up, Saros is precisely where Sony decided to start its latest showcase, offering a first gameplay look at what the studio is calling an "emotional and haunting story" set on the shape-sharing planet of Carcosa. This first proper taste of Saros spotlighted several of protagonist Arjun Devraj's abilities, including his Soltari Shield - capable of defending and absorbing projectiles - and his Power Weapon, used to blast back those absorbed projectiles. Along his journey, Devraj can probe Hololog's to learn more about the planet, but mostly the focus appears to be on the kind of eye-searing action that made Returnal so compelling. Saros arrives on 20th March next year, along with PS5 Pro enhancements, and Housemarque says it'll be sharing more in the months leading up to its release. ZA/UM's Zero Parades: For Dead Spies returns ZA/UM - or at least what's left of the studio behind the highly acclaimed Disco Elysium after countless controversies and staff departures - popped up with another trailer for Zero Parades: For Dead Spies. Previous showing have described it as an espionage RPG in which players - as one Hershel Wilk - must make acquaintances with various useful people at the end of history. It's got a visual style very reminiscent of Disco Elysium, and it's out next year. Microsoft Flight Simulator finally confirmed for PS5 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has long been rumoured for release on PlayStation 5, but finally it's official - and there's a release date! Wannabe pilots looking to take to the skies for an aeronautical jaunt across Flight Simulator's sumptuous 1:1 digital recreation of earth can do just that when it launches for Sony's console on 8th December this year. A trailer! Battlefield 6 gets a new campaign mode trailer Battlefield 6's imminent arrival is hardly a surprise - EA's heavy pre-launch promotion has made sure of that - but even if it's already on your radar, you might like this briefest of new looks. EA's latest Battlefield 6 trailer teases a little more of its campaign mode, and if that's sufficiently whetted your appetite, the full game releases for PS5 on 10th October. Legendary immersive sim Deus Ex is getting a remaster Deux Ex - the classic cyberpunk immersive sim from developer Ion Storm and designer Warren Spector - is 25 this year, and it's celebrating the occasion with a brand-new remaster, courtesy of Aspyr. There's talk of updated controls, new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures - alongside the likes of rebuilt character models, lip-synced dialogue, and ragdoll physics. However, Aspyr is calling this a 'careful modernisation' intended to preserve the original's DNA. We'll find out what that looks like on 5th February next year. Halloween gameplay reveal and release date At this rate, there'll be no horror movie classics left untouched by the asymmetrical schtick stick. This time, it's the turn of John Carpenter's seminal slasher Halloween, which - like Friday the 13th: The Game, Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds before it -
