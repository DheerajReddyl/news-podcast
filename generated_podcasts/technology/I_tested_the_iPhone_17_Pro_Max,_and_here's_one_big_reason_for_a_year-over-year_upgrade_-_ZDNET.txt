The next story is: I tested the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and here's one big reason for a year-over-year upgrade - ZDNET. Apple iPhone 17 Pro Max ZDNET's key takeaways The new flagship iPhone brings two big photography upgrades, in the zoom camera and the front-facing camera The new A19 Pro processor, the N1 chip, and the thermal upgrades combine to rev up performance For the author, this year's upgrade choice boils down to overcoming a flaw in the past two Pro Max models View now at Amazon View now at Best Buy View now at T-Mobile more buying choices As far as annual upgrades go, we got a lot in the iPhone 17 Pro Max -- a redesign, a change of materials, new colors, a battery upgrade, a processor made even more intentionally for AI, two big camera refinements, and a fix for last year's biggest flaw. But how does it fit together in one package, what's it like to use, and is it worth the upgrade? We're here to discuss these questions, as we do every year. As far as iPhone reviews go, I've combined my iPhone Pro and Pro Max reviews into one story for the last several years, because the two have been so similar. They are more similar than ever this year, with the only differences being the larger screen and larger battery in the Pro Max. Also: Best iPhone 2025: I compared the top models and found the best options for you So this year, I'm just going to make my review all about the iPhone 17 Pro Max. You can safely assume virtually all of this applies to the Pro model as well, if the smaller Pro is your jam. I have upgraded iPhones every year since the first iPhone in 2007, and the Pro Max has been the iPhone model I've upgraded to every year since the first one arrived with the iPhone 11 Pro Max in 2019.

Also: iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: I compared the flagship handsets, and there's a winner This year, Apple has already dedicated 40% of its manufacturing capacity to churning out the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with 25% going to the iPhone 17 Pro, 25% to the iPhone 17, and 10% to the iPhone Air, according to The Information. So Apple is already expecting the iPhone 17 Pro Max to be its No. 1 seller, and by a bigger margin ever. That makes sense considering there's no Plus model this year, so the Pro Max is now the only big-screen iPhone. Jason Hiner/ZDNET Again, I'm going all-in on the Pro Max this year for my review. Nevertheless, for the past decade, I haven't recommended anyone to upgrade to the latest iPhone if they already had last year's iPhone -- despite the fact that I upgrade each year because of the work I do. However, my buying advice is different this year, so stay tuned for that at the end. What's new in the iPhone 17 Pro Max First, let's do a quick lightning round on new features, but I'll save what I consider the four biggest upgrades to talk about in just a moment. The A19 Pro - One of the unsung heroes of the iPhone's success and its broad appeal is its powerful Apple Silicon chips that make it
