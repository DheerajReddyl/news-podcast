Our next story is titled: Console wars death watch: Microsoft Flight Simulator coming to PS5 in December - Ars Technica. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will come to the PlayStation 5 on December 8.

Still, it's a bit striking to see a franchise that literally has the Microsoft brand name integrated into its title moving to a major non-Microsoft platform. And that concludes this report.
