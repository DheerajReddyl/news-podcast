Our next story is titled: Study links magnesium supplements to gut bacteria growth and reduced colorectal cancer risk, especially in women - Mint. Magnesium supplementation increases gut bacteria crucial for synthesizing vitamin D and possibly reducing colorectal cancer risk. The effect was most pronounced in females, with researchers suggesting that estrogen may be a mechanism for enhancing magnesium's cellular uptake, and thus its effects. The local effects of magnesium may help mitigate risk factors associated with coloreCTal cancer, even in the absence of sunlight. The study paves the way for precision-based strategies in colorectoral cancer prevention, emphasizing the significant role of magnesium and gut health. And that concludes this report.
