Our next story is titled: Scientists sound alarm after making unsettling discovery deep in human bones: 'There's a gap in our knowledge' - Yahoo. A meta-analysis of existing research has found microplastics inside our bones. Microplastics have already been shown to affect cell viability, modify gene expression, and trigger inflammatory responses. The world produces over 500 million tons of plastic every single year, with an estimated 22 million tons ending up in the environment as litter. The only solution is to drastically reduce the amount of new plastic being produced. To help make a difference at the individual level, you can take steps to reduce your own plastic use. And that concludes this report.
