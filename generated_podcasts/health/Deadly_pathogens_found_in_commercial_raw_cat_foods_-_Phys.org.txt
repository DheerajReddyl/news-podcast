Our next story is titled: Deadly pathogens found in commercial raw cat foods - Phys.org. Analysis of commercial raw cat foods has detected disease-causing microbes. Salmonella, Cronobacter and E. coli were found in such foods as raw or partially cooked meat. These pathogens can transfer from pets to humans and are of special concern for young children, people who are old, pregnant and immuno-compromised. The Food and Drug Administration regulates and tests a limited number of bacteria in raw cat food, due to compliance policies, which mainly focus on human pathogens. And that concludes this report.
