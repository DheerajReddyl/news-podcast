Our next story is titled: The rare disease that stops us feeling fear - BBC. Jordy Cernik had his adrenal glands removed to reduce anxiety caused by Cushing's syndrome. The treatment worked a little too well. Jordy stopped feeling anxious – but something was wrong. On a 2012 trip to Disneyland, he went on a rollercoaster ride and realised that he felt no fear. He subsequently skydived out of a plane, zip-wired off the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle and abseiled down the Shard in London – all without feeling the smallest raised pulse. And that concludes this report.
