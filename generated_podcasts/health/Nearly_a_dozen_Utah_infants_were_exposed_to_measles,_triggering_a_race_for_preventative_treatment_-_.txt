Our next story is titled: Nearly a dozen Utah infants were exposed to measles, triggering a race for preventative treatment - The Salt Lake Tribune. The 11 infants were exposed at Intermountain Healthâ€™s Budge Clinic in Logan on Sept. 15. The exposure happened when the infants had visited the same clinic as an infected person. None of the babies were eligible to receive the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Utah has now seen 41 officially confirmed measles cases this year, four of which were found in the Bear River district, health officials say. The state recommends children receive their first dose on or after their first birthday. And that concludes this report.
