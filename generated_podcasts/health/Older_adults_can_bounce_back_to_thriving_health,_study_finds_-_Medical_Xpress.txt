Our next story is titled: Older adults can bounce back to thriving health, study finds - Medical Xpress. Researchers at the University of Toronto have found that nearly one in four older adults age 60 or older who reported poor well-being at the beginning of a national study had regained optimal well- being within just three years. Remarkably, individuals who reported strong psychological and emotional wellness at the outset were over five times more likely to achieve this very high bar. The study has important implications: Aging-related policies and programs are needed that prioritize whole-person wellness and acknowledge that recovery is not only possible, but common. And that concludes this report.
