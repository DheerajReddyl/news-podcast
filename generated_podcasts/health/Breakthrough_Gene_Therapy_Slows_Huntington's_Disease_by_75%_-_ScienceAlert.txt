Our next story is titled: Breakthrough Gene Therapy Slows Huntington's Disease by 75% - ScienceAlert. Researchers in the United Kingdom say they have successfully trialed what could become the world's first gene therapy for Huntington's disease. The highest dose can apparently slow disease progression by as much as 75 percent over three years. It also led to a significant reduction in a biomarker of neurodegeneration, found in cerebrospinal fluid, which usually increases with disease progression. A parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to their children. The company is now conducting further clinical trials in the US and Europe. And that concludes this report.
