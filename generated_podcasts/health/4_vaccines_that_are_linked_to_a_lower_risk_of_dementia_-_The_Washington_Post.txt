The next story is: 4 vaccines that are linked to a lower risk of dementia - The Washington Post. Vaccines don’t just protect us from infectious diseases or lessen their effects. Some are also associated with a reduced risk for dementia, research shows. “They’ll protect against these really potentially severe infections, especially in older adults, and preventing that alone is huge,” said Avram Bukhbinder, a resident physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who has conducted research on vaccines and dementia risk. “There seems to also be some kind of added benefit and ultimately it just adds a more compelling reason” to get routine vaccines, he said.

The flu shot An estimated 47 million to 82 million people in the United States — about 13 to 24 percent of all people — caught influenza, or the flu, during the 2024-2025 season with 27,000 to 130,000 Americans dying as a result, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Flu season generally runs from October to May in North America.) Advertisement Influenza and pneumonia — a potential complication of flu — are associated with five neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia and Parkinson’s disease, according to a 2023 study analyzing biobank data from over 400,000 people. “I don’t know how many times in the adult world we hear, ‘My loved one got flu, was in the hospital for a week or two, and it just was never the same.’ Like quickly went downhill from there,” Bukhbinder said. Many studies have found that flu vaccination is associated with a lower risk of dementia years later. In a 2022 study, Bukhbinder and his colleagues at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston examined a large health database of over 1.8 million adults ages 65 and over. They found that those who received at least one flu vaccine were 40 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s — the most common form of dementia — during the next four years.

The CDC recommends all people over 6 months old get annual flu shots, typically in September or October. Fewer than half of Americans typically get their flu vaccine each season.

In one 2025 study, researchers tracked more than 280,000 adults in Wales and found that the shingles vaccine was linked with reducing dementia risk by 20 percent over a seven-year period. Advertisement “There may be potential additional benefits beyond the protection that the vaccine provides for a particular condition,” said Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the senior author of the study. “So, that’s only an additional reason to get vaccinated.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A subsequent study examining over 100,000 patients in Australia similarly found that getting vaccinated for shingles was associated with reduced dementia risk. If you are eligible, you should probably get a shingles vaccine regardless of its chances
