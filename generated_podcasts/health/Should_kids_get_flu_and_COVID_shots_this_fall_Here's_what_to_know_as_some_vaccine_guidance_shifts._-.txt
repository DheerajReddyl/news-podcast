The next story is: Should kids get flu and COVID shots this fall? Here's what to know as some vaccine guidance shifts. - CBS News. As the fall respiratory season approaches and differing recommendations for children's COVID-19 and flu shots cause confusion, who should be getting vaccinated to protect against illness? Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, voted to change recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine. The ACIP's recommendations are not the final say — they must be reviewed and approved by the CDC director to become official guidance. But CDC directors have almost always accepted the recommendations. Here's where recommendations currently stand. Flu shots Guidance on the flu shot for kids is consistent across top medical groups: Children 6 months and older are generally advised to get the shot. The CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every season, with rare exceptions. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) also recommends that everyone 6 months and older without medical contradictions get vaccinated. For pregnant women, flu shots — specifically the injection, not the nasal spray — are also recommended by both the CDC and AAP. Protecting kids from the flu is important because infections can lead to hospitalizations and sometimes be deadly, the CDC says. During the 2023-24 flu season, for example, the CDC reported nearly 200 flu-related deaths among children in the U.S. Most of them were eligible for a vaccine but were not fully vaccinated, the CDC said. Flu season typically starts in December and peaks in February, so the optimal time to get vaccinated is heading into the season, doctors say. It takes about 2 weeks for protection to develop after vaccination. COVID vaccine For the COVID-19 vaccine, advice currently varies. The CDC says parents of healthy children ages 6 months to 17 years old should discuss the benefits with a health care provider and "may receive" it, but the agency stops short of recommending the shot. The agency broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, however, recently shared vaccine recommendations that, for the first time in three decades, differ from U.S. government advice. In the guidance, the AAP is "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. For older children, shots are also advised but it's up to parents' discretion, the AAP said. Other top medical groups have also shared recommendations differing from the CDC's advice. For example, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a medical association representing physicians and scientists who specialize in infectious diseases, recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. And a group of four West Coast states has joined together to issue recommendations on COVID-19 shots and other vaccines that differ from CDC guidance. The West Coast Health Alliance recommends the COVID vaccine for all children 6 months to 23 months old and those 2 to 18 years old with risk factors or who have never been vaccinated. The announcement was made last week in a joint statement from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, all Democrats, saying they were putting safety before politics. In the Northeast, New York and its neighbors created the Northeast Public Health Collaborative, with Gov. Kathy Hochul calling it a rebuke to Washington's retreat from science. The voluntary coalition includes New York state, New York City, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. "Every resident will have access to the COVID vaccine, no exceptions," Hochul said in a statement, which advises vaccinations for children 6 months to 18 years old. CDC
