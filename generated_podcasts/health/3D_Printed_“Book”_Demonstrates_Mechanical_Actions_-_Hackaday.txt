Our next story is titled: 3D Printed “Book” Demonstrates Mechanical Actions - Hackaday. A book of mechanical actions is a wondrous thing — mechanically inclined children have lost collective decades pouring over them over the generations. What could possibly be better? Why, if the mechanisms in the book were present, and moved! That’s exactly what [AxelMadeIt] produced for a recent video. All pages are driven from an electric motor that is buried in the last page of the “book” along with its motor, battery, and a couple of micro-switches to turn it on. And that concludes this report.
