Our next story is titled: Sexually transmitted disease cases fall, but not syphilis in newborns - AP News. CDC data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases. Second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis. But congenital syphilis cases, in which infected moms pass the disease to their babies, arenâ€™t seeing the same improvements. Such infections in infants can lead to deaths or lifelong health problems such as deafness, blindness, and malformed bones. The number and rate of newborn cases has been rising since 2012, when about 300 were reported. And that concludes this report.
