The next story is: ‘South Park’: Trump Terrorizes FCC Chair Brendan Carr While Kyle’s Mom Goes to Israel to Yell at Netanyahu - Variety. In the fifth episode of “South Park” Season 27, Kyle and his mother go to war with prediction market apps while Donald Trump inadvertently terrorizes FCC chair Brendan Carr while trying to kill his butt baby with Satan. South Park Elementary is once again engrossed in another fad. This time around, it’s prediction market apps, which, according to Stan, are a form of “social platform betting. People can make any bet they want and users take them up on it.” Cartman fills Kyle in on the hottest bets on campus, which include, “Will the girls’ soccer team win on Friday? Will there be a snow day this month? Will Kyle’s mom strike Gaza and destroy a Palestinian hospital?” Enraged, Kyle is quick to blame Cartman for the antisemitic wager, but Cartman claims he had nothing to do with it. Kyle storms off and vows to find whoever is responsible. His search leads him to Carr and the FCC. Upon hearing there is an “offensive government app” on the market, he rushes to the White House to warn Trump. Popular on Variety Meanwhile, Trump is plotting how to get rid of his unborn butt baby with Satan so that he won’t have to give up his extravagant lifestyle. However, every time he tries to lure his lover into a trap, a frantic Carr becomes the unintended target. First, Trump tries to use a rope and grease to make Satan fall down the stairs, but Carr is the one to take a nasty tumble. Trump then tries to give Satan a stew laced with Plan B. However, Satan doesn’t like carrots, leaving Carr to slurp down the poisoned dish. Finally, Trump tries to infect Satan with toxoplasmosis by dumping pounds of kitty litter on him. However, Carr stumbles into the elaborate trap, landing him in the hospital. When visiting Carr in the ICU, JD Vance asks the doctor about Carr’s condition, and the physician replies, “His bones are healing, so he may regain full range of motion. But if the toxoplasmosis parasite gets to his brain, I’m afraid he may lose his freedom of speech.” Vance is delighted to hear Carr is in critical condition. He wants anyone out of the way who could take his place as next in line to the presidency. Threatening Carr to keep his interference to a minimum, Vance tells him, “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.” Back in South Park, Kyle’s mom is determined to find out who created the bet on whether or not she will attack Gaza. The search takes her to Israel, where she confronts Benjamin Netanyahu about the Palestinian conflict. “There you are, Mr. Netanyahu,” Kyle’s mom yells. “Just who do you think you are, killing thousands and flattening neighborhoods, then wrapping yourself in Judaism like it’s some shield from criticism?” Hours before fans were expecting the initial release of episode 5 on Sept. 17, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone took to X to announce that the latest “South Park” installment was not ready for release, and had to be pushed a week to Sept. 24. “Apparently when you do everything at the last minute sometimes you don’t get it done,” they said. “This one’s on us. We didn’t get it done in time. Thanks to Comedy Central and ‘South Park’ fans for being so understanding. Tune in next week!” The last new episode, released on Sept. 3, took a slight detour from politics to cover another ubiquitous chapter in our current cultural zeitgeist: Labubus. However, fans still got a bombshell update in Donald Trump’s relationship
