The next story is: Paul Thomas Anderson on writing, The PCC and One Battle After Another - Dazed. Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film, One Battle After Another, is considerably his most expensive effort to date. It was also, like There Will Be Blood, The Master, Phantom Thread, and the rest of his subversive filmography, written on Microsoft Word. “I’m still stuck on the world’s worst programme,” the 55-year-old director tells me over the phone from LA, laughing. “It’s stubbornness. It makes no sense. It’s an addiction that’s really unhealthy.” After all, Anderson has a touch of old-school about him. The majority of his films are period dramas shot on celluloid. He explains that using Microsoft Word instead of Final Draft is like bashing out scripts on a typewriter with a sheet of paper. “Deep down, I like to write the characters’ names. I like to hit tabs.” Does the inconvenience force him to think more about the dialogue? “Exactly. It’s those hiccups you have to do.” For around 20 years, Anderson has been tinkering with one draft after another of One Battle After Another. At one point, the Word document was 600 pages long. (He claims it was easy to cut down because “500 of those pages were shit”.) With car chases, shootouts, and an action-heavy narrative that lives up to the title, One Battle After Another is Anderson at his most ambitious: it allegedly cost $150 million, which is approximately the cost of his five previous films combined. Yet it’s still as peculiar and perverse as you’d hope from a director who made it rain frogs in Magnolia. “It felt no different than my other films,” says Anderson. “Magnolia, we shot for 100 days, and this was about the same, but with a break in the middle. When I look around, I’m with the 15 familiar faces I’ve always worked with. Whether you’re doing a car chase in the desert, or a scene of a baby being born in a room in Inglewood, it’s still the same 15 of us.” Shot on 35mm with VistaVision cameras, One Battle After Another starts off with a radical group, the French 1975, and two of its activists, Bob Ferguson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Perfidia (Teyana Taylor), forming a romance fuelled by fighting fascism. When Perfidia has a secret tryst with Colonel Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn), the revolutionaries disband and Bob flees with their child. Two decades later, Bob lives alone with his daughter, Willa (Chase Infiniti), the latter crestfallen to learn the truth about her mother: she was, in Willa’s words, a “rat”. With Lockjaw desperate to join a racist cult known as The Christmas Adventurers Club (yes, this isn’t your typical studio blockbuster), Bob and Willa’s home is targeted; Willa is rescued by a former French 1975 member, Deandra (Regina Hall), while Bob struggles to locate his daughter due to forgetting a password. Assisting him is Willa’s beer-drinking karate teacher Sergio (Benicio del Toro). Like The Dude in The Big Lebowski, DiCaprio spends almost the entirety of the action-comedy adventure in a dressing gown. I’ve had this overwhelming feeling lately. In the past week, I’ve had to remember how I got here, and I’ve genuinely come to the conclusion that what’s taken so long is that I was waiting to meet Chase Infiniti Set in the present day, it’s Anderson’s first film to feature smartphones. “I have to thank Leo and Chase for bringing it to my attention that the phone could be a ticking time bomb. If she’s got a secret phone from her crazy-ass dad who won’t let her have one, then we’ve got a real problem in terms of the plot – in a good way. Which
