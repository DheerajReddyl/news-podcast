Our next story is titled: Disney Hikes Streaming Prices, Trump Threatens Lawsuit Over Jimmy Kimmel - Investor's Business Daily. Disney and ABC pulled "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" last Wednesday due to comments about President Donald Trump. Broadcasters Sinclair and Nexstar refused to air the show on their networks. Kimmel returned to the set of his late night show Tuesday night, his first show on air after Disney and ABC withdrew the show. The decision was based on his reaction to the Sept. 10 killing of conservative podcaster and activist Charlie Kirk, who was killed by a gunman in Las Vegas. The show will air at 10 p.m. ET. And that concludes this report.
