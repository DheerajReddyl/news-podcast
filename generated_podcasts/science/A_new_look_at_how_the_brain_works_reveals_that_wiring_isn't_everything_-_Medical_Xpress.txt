Our next story is titled: A new look at how the brain works reveals that wiring isn't everything - Medical Xpress. Scientists compared the worm's physical wiring in the brain to its signaling network. The team discovered that the brain's functional organization differs from its anatomical structure. The research may well have been conducted in a tiny worm, but the findings have enormous implications for us. This may help improve our understanding of neurological disorders like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, which involve an interruption in brain's ability to process information. The findings have been published in PRX Life, a journal of the University of California, San Diego. And that concludes this report.
