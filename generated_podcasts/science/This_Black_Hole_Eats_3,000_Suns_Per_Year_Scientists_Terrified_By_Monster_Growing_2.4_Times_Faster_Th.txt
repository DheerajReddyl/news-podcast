In the vast stretches of the universe, astronomers have uncovered a phenomenon that defies our understanding of cosmic evolution. A quasar named RACS J0320-35, situated at an almost unimaginable distance, is challenging the conventional theories of black hole growth. This celestial object, which has been traveling for 12.8 billion years to reach us, appears to have amassed a mass equivalent to a billion suns just 920 million years after the Big Bang. Its extraordinary growth rate and brightness in X-rays have left scientists puzzled and intrigued, prompting a re-evaluation of existing theories. Catching a Giant Cosmic Anomaly The journey to discovering RACS J0320-35 began with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) identifying a bright, faraway object. Initial observations were followed up using telescopes in Chile, which confirmed its nature as a quasar. Quasars are known for their immense brightness, powered by supermassive black holes consuming vast amounts of gas and outshining entire galaxies. However, what sets RACS J0320-35 apart is its unexpected behavior, identified during X-ray observations by the Chandra Observatory in 2023. Traditionally, the growth of black holes is limited by the Eddington limit, a balance between gravitational pull and radiation push. This limit acts as a speed cap, preventing excessive material from falling in. Yet, RACS J0320-35 defies this cap, growing at a rate 2.4 times the Eddington limit. This translates to consuming material equivalent to 300 to 3,000 suns annually, marking the fastest growth rate recorded for a black hole in the universe‚Äôs infancy. Such findings suggest that our understanding of early black hole growth might need significant revision. What Does This Growth Mean? Traditionally, it was believed that early black holes could only reach a billion solar masses if they were born massive from the collapse of giant gas clouds. RACS J0320-35 challenges this notion. If it has indeed been growing at such extreme rates, it could have started significantly smaller, perhaps from the death of massive stars, with a mass under 100 suns. This opens up new possibilities for understanding black hole formation. The ability to trace its growth backward allows scientists to estimate its initial mass and test new theories on black hole genesis. Moreover, this quasar exhibits another fascinating feature: jets of particles moving at nearly the speed of light. Such jets are rare among quasars, and researchers believe its rapid growth might be connected to the formation of these jets. This discovery not only sets a new record but also challenges existing models of black hole and universe evolution. If black holes can grow this rapidly, the need for exotic conditions to explain massive black holes shortly after the Big Bang might be unnecessary. Instead, under suitable conditions, ordinary black holes might have grown significantly faster than previously thought. Implications for Understanding the Early Universe The implications of RACS J0320-35's growth extend beyond just black hole formation. It could reshape our understanding of the early universe's evolution. The existence of such rapidly growing black holes suggests that the conditions in the early universe might have been more conducive to black hole growth than previously assumed. This could
