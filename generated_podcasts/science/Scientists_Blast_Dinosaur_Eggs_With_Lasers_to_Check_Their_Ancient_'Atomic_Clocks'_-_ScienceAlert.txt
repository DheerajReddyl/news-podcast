Our next story is titled: Scientists Blast Dinosaur Eggs With Lasers to Check Their Ancient 'Atomic Clocks' - ScienceAlert. Researchers in China have dated dinosaur eggs directly for the first time. A micro-laser was used to vaporize small portions of an eggshell, which released a cloud of radioactive uranium atoms. This allowed the researchers to tease out a more precise age coinciding with the Upper Cretaceous around 85 million years ago. Most of the eggs had been laid by a still-mysterious species known as Placoolithus tumiaolingensis, though it's uncertain what species laid the eggs dated in this study. And that concludes this report.
