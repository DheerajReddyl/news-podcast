Averages and uncertainties are shown for 4,022 observations from 227 observatories worldwide, which were binned in time. The residuals are consistent with zero between May 15 and September 23, 2025. Given its mass loss, the lack of non-gravitational acceleration during this period implies that 3I/ATLAS is more massive than 33 billion tons and its diameter is larger than 5 kilometers. (Credit: Cloete, Loeb & Veres 2025) BREAKING NEWS: the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is anomalously massive and large! In a new paper (accessible here) that I co-authored with Richard Cloete and Peter Veres, we used data on the motion of 3I/ATLAS — as compiled by the Minor Planet Center between May 15 and September 23, 2025, to set an upper limit on the deviation of 3I/ATLAS from a trajectory sculpted by gravity alone. The net upper limit on residuals is 0.028 arcseconds, taking account of 4,022 observations over a period of several months, implying that the non-gravitational acceleration of 3I/ATLAS was smaller than 15 meters per day squared. The total mass loss rate and outflow speed from its surface were inferred from the Webb Space Telescope data on August 6, 2025 (accessible here). Given that the rocket effect is not noticeable, the mass of 3I/ATLAS must be bigger than 33 billion tons. Consequently, the diameter of its solid-density nucleus must be larger than 5 kilometers. This suggests that 3I/ATLAS is more massive than the other two interstellar objects, 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov by 3–5 orders of magnitude, constituting a major anomaly. Given the limited reservoir of heavy elements, we should have discovered on the order of a hundred thousand interstellar objects on the 0.1-kilometer scale of 1I/`Oumuamua before finding 3I/ATLAS, yet we only detected two interstellar objects previously. Our analysis compared the evolution in the observed sky positions of 3I/ATLAS (Right Ascension [RA] and Declination [Dec]) to the trajectory expected from gravity alone. The optical astrometric data span 4,022 individual measurements from 227 observatories worldwide. The comparison to the expected sky positions provided a net upper limit of 0.028 arcseconds on sky position shifts during the 4.5 months between May 15 and September 23, 2025. A systematic trend is unlikely to be affected by a shift in the centroid of light owing to the development of a bright spot away from the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS. The highest-resolution image of 3I/ATLAS, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025 (accessible here), showed an optically-thin anti-tail in the direction of the Sun which persisted during July and most of August (and analyzed here). On August 27, 2025, imaging by the Gemini South telescope revealed the growth of a faint tail from 3I/ATLAS away from the Sun (as reported here). Throughout the entire period, the brightest point remained centered on the nucleus. Over a short time interval, T, a non-gravitational acceleration, A, results in a positional shift that grows as 0.5*A*T². Given that the distance of 3I/ATLAS from Earth in mid-August was 2.6 times the Earth-Sun separation (as discussed by the SPHEREx team here), our upper limit on the sky position shift translates to an upper limit on the non-gravitational acceleration, A<15 meters per day squared. Momentum conservation implies that 3I/ATLAS must be massive in order not to be pushed back
