Our next story is titled: ESCAPADE launch on New Glenn planned for late October or early November - SpaceNews. The launch of the Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers, or ESCAPADE, mission was scheduled for Sept. 29. A launch on that date appeared increasingly unlikely given the state of both spacecraft and launch vehicle preparations. The spacecraft, nicknamed Blue and Gold, were originally shipped from Rocket Labâ€™s Long Beach, California, factory to Florida in August 2024 for a launch then scheduled for October of that year. NASA halted preparations in early September when it determined New Glenn would not be ready in time. And that concludes this report.
