Our next story is titled: A “cosmic carpool” is traveling to a distant space weather observation post - Ars Technica. SpaceX launches three missions to study the solar wind. The missions will send data back to Earth in real-time. The first mission is called the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) The second and third missions will study the outermost layer of the solar system, known as the heliosphere. The fourth and final mission will study solar winds in the Earth's ionosphere, or coronal mass ejection zone, which is about 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) away. And that concludes this report.
