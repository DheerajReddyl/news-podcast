Our next story is titled: Scientists make incredible breakthrough after aiming almost 200 lasers at tiny target: 'Far more powerful' - Yahoo. In 2022, scientists at California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory managed to achieve fusion "ignition" for the very first time. The process involved firing 192 extremely powerful lasers at a tiny capsule containing fusion fuel. A new startup in the Bay Area called Inertia aims to commercialize the lab's method for fusion energy with an end goal of achieving affordable, clean energy. The first step is to create lasers that are significantly more powerful than the ones used in the original experiments. The final step of the process will be the creation of a new power plant. And that concludes this report.
