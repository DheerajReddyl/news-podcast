The idea that space-time exists is no more viable than the outdated belief that the celestial sphere exists: both are observer-centered models that are powerful and convenient for describing the world, but neither represents reality itself. Yet from the standpoints of modern physics, philosophy, popular science communication and familiar themes in science fiction, stating that space-time does not exist is contentious. But what would it mean for a world where everything that has ever happened or will happen somehow "exists" now as part of an interwoven fabric? Events are not locations It's easy to imagine past events—like losing a tooth or receiving good news—as existing somewhere. Fictional representations of time travel underscore this: time travelers alter events and disrupt the timeline, as if past and future events were locations one could visit with the right technology. Philosophers often talk this way too. Eternalism says all events across all time exist. The growing block view suggests the past and present exist while the future will come to be. Presentism says only the present exists, while the past used to exist and the future will when it happens. And general relativity presents a four-dimensional continuum that bends and curves—we tend to imagine that continuum of events as really existing. The confusion emerges out of the definition of the word "exist." With space-time, it's applied uncritically to a mathematical description of happenings—turning a model into an ontological theory on the nature of being. A totality In physics, space-time is the continuous set of events that happen throughout space and time—from here to the furthest galaxy, from the Big Bang to the far future. It is a four-dimensional map that records and measures where and when everything happens. In physics, an event is an instantaneous occurrence at a specific place and time. An instant is the three-dimensional collection of spatially separated events that happen "at the same time" (with relativity's usual caveat that simultaneity depends on one's relative state of rest). Space-time is the totality of all events that ever happen. It's also our most powerful way of cataloging the world's happenings. That cataloging is indispensable, but the words and concepts we use for it matter. There are infinitely many points in the three dimensions of space, and at every instant as time passes a unique event occurs at each location. Positionings throughout time Physicists describe a car traveling straight at constant speed with a simple space-time diagram: position on one axis, time on the other. Instants stack together to form a two-dimensional space-time. The car's position is a point within each instant, and those points join to form a worldline—the full record of the car's position throughout the time interval, whose slope is the car's speed. Real motion is far more complex. The car rides along on a rotating Earth orbiting the sun, which orbits the Milky Way as it drifts through the local universe. Plotting the car's position at every instant ultimately requires four-dimensional space-time. Space-time is the map of where and when events happen. A worldline is the record of every event that occurs throughout one's life. The key question is whether the map—or all the events it draws together at once—should be said to exist in the same way that cars, people and the places they go exist. Discover the latest in
