Our next story is titled: It’s A Bird! It’s A Plane! It’s… An Air Breathing Satellite?! - Hackaday. Air-breathing satellites would hang out in very low earth orbit. The drag is too dominant for the current “coast on momentum” satellite paradigm to work. You don’t need a lot of thrust to stabilize against drag, after all, and the thin whisps of air at 200 km or 300 km above ground level should provide ample reaction mass for some kind of solar-electric ion engine. The devil is in the details, of course, and [Eager Space] spends 13 minutes discussing challenges (like corrosive monoatomic oxygen) And that concludes this report.
