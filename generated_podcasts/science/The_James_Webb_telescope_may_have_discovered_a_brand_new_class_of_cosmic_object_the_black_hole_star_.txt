The next story is: The James Webb telescope may have discovered a brand new class of cosmic object: the black hole star - Yahoo. An illustration of a black hole star — a potentially new class of cosmic object with a feeding black hole at its center, and a dense cocoon of turbulent gas surrounding it like a star. Astronomers have discovered a new object that could help shed light on mysterious " little red dots " that were first spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2022. The newfound object, dubbed "the Cliff," suggests that the little red dots represent a totally new class of cosmic objects known as a "black hole star," the researchers say. This newly hypothesized object would essentially be a black hole feeding so rapidly that it lights up the thick cocoon of gas surrounding it, making it glow like a star. Previously, astronomers had proposed alternative explanations for these tiny red objects. Initially, they were thought to be massive galaxies from the early universe , and later, they were linked to actively feeding supermassive black holes. However, all of these theories are still evolving, so it's unclear whether the dots are exotic objects or simply a stage in the growth of galaxies or black holes. When they were first discovered, little red dots were dubbed "universe breakers" because they seemed too old to exist in the first few billion years of the universe. Therefore, astronomers looked beyond the standard types of known objects to find an explanation for what they might be. They proposed two models. "One possibility is that Little Red Dots are extremely massive and compact galaxies with intense star formation, leading to very large stellar densities in their cores,"said Fabio Pacucci , an astrophysicist at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the new study. This scenario suggests that little red dots are tiny-but-dense galaxies and rich in stars and that they involve exotic, never-before-seen processes. "The other possibility is that they host massive black holes at their centers, often appearing 'overmassive' compared to the stellar mass of their galaxies," he told Live Science in an email. In both cases, the redness would be due to the enormous dust surrounding the object . The second explanation would mean that little red dots are galaxies that are powered by a massive black hole at their centers, like an active galactic nucleus (AGN). These black hole-fueled galaxies would be nothing like the other type of AGNs found in the early universe, known as quasars — extremely bright objects that are powered by large supermassive black holes and are easily detectable because they are not blocked by dust. The connection between these two types of populations remains unclear. Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

A "Cliff"-hanger In the new study, published Sept. 10 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics , a team of astronomers led by Anna de Graaff of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy looked at a peculiar little red dot that existed 1.8 billion years after the Big Bang. This little red dot, whose light took almost 12 billion years to reach us, was discovered among many other little red dots identified in the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES) obtained with JWST. In the light of this object, the researchers noticed a very sharp jump in the brightness called the Balmer break. While this kind
