The next story is: Crocodile-eating apex dinosaur reveals missing link in predator evolution - Yahoo. A rare fossil of Joaquinraptor casali from Patagonia reveals a powerful predator that may have dined on crocodiles. (CREDIT: The Brighter Side of News / AI-generated) A fossil from the blustery plains of Patagonia is revising your book on one of the most elusive bands of hunting dinosaurs. The newly discovered dinosaur, Joaquinraptor casali, preyed on the soggy floodplains in Argentina about 67 million years ago, just before an asteroid that ended the age of dinosaurs. Weighing nearly a ton and measuring nearly 23 feet in length, this meat-eater was as much a brawny killer as a glimpse into the way its relatives lived out to the last chapter of the Cretaceous. The discovery has researchers buzzing not only because the skeleton turned out to be unexpectedly intact but also over a horrifying find trapped in its jaws—the arm of a crocodile-type reptile. It's a revengeful, guttural glimpse into the diet of this apex predator. A Remarkably Complete Skeleton The fossil was found in 2019 in the Lago Colhué Huapi area of Chubut Province, central Patagonia. The formation rocks are Maastrichtian stage Cretaceous, setting the animal's life within a couple of million years of the global extinction event. That makes Joaquinraptor one of the youngest megaraptorids to be found. Location of the study area in south-central Chubut Province, central Patagonia, Argentina.

Most megaraptor fossils are fragmentary—sometimes a handful of bones at best—while this skeleton preserved much of the skull, jaws, vertebrae, ribs, and both the fore- and hindlimbs. Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist Matt Lamanna described it as "among the most complete megaraptoran skeletons known to science.". Anatomy Designed for the Hunt Megaraptorans were a family of extinct, three-fingered, long-armed carnivorous dinosaurs that had enormous claws on the hands and long heads. Joaquinraptor shared these same traits, except for a pair of unexpected differences. Its humerus, the bone of the upper arm, was an unusually thick, stout one, suggesting muscles capable of rending flesh. The ulna, a bone of the forearm, had an extended process for attachment of muscles, giving the dinosaur added force in the arms. Its claws were large and slightly hooked, well suited to tearing into flesh but not to crunching bone. The skull, reaching 28 inches in length, held rows of curved teeth that were fairly small for a predator of such size. That odd combination indicates an animal that employed as much its powerful arms and claws as its bite. The fossil was estimated to be 19 years old, as determined from microscopic growth rings in its bones. Like tree rings, these lines are a chronicle of yearly cycles of growth. The distance between them revealed that the dinosaur had slowed down in growth, likely having achieved sexual maturity but still not at full adult size.

In between its teeth was the crocodyliform upper arm bone, a relative of today's crocodiles. Some of the Joaquinraptor teeth were jammed against the bone, and paleontologists observed clear bite marks. Lucio Ibiricu, first author of the study,
