FRBs are extremely energetic flashes from distant sources from across the universe that are caused by extreme astrophysical phenomena. Yet, they remain poorly understood by scientists and are among astronomy's most mysterious phenomena. Pinpointing their location promises to usher in a new era of discovery, allowing scientists to trace their true cosmic origins. The new FRB signal, called FRB 20250316A and playfully nicknamed RBFLOAT ("radio brightest flash of all time"), was very precisely localized using a new FRB Outrigger array as part of the Canadian Hydrogen-Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), which has detected thousands of FRBs since 2018. These smaller versions of the CHIME instrument—located in British Columbia, Northern California and West Virginia—allow astronomers to perform very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), a technique that can pinpoint the location of FRBs with unprecedented accuracy. "We were ultimately extremely lucky that we were able to pinpoint the precise sky position of this rare event," said Mattias Lazda, a U of T Ph.D. student in the David A. Dunlap department of astronomy and astrophysics in the Faculty of Arts & Science, who is an author on two new papers about the discovery. "A few hours after we detected it, we experienced a power outage at one of our telescope sites that played a critical role in telling us where the burst came from. Had the event happened any later that day, we would've completely missed our chance." Although FRBs are among the most powerful radio sources in the universe, they last only a few milliseconds to seconds, briefly outshining all other radio sources in their galaxy. RBFLOAT, detected on March 16, 2025, lasted only about one-fifth of a second. "Cosmically speaking, this fast radio burst is just in our neighborhood," says Kiyoshi Masui, associate professor of physics and affiliate of MIT's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. "This means we get this chance to study a pretty normal FRB in exquisite detail." RBFLOAT was so bright because the source was relatively nearby in the outskirts of a galaxy called NGC 4141, which is about 130 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major. The signal was traced to a region 45 light-years across—smaller than the average star cluster—representing an unprecedented spatial resolution. It is equivalent to observing a guitar pick from 1,000 kilometers away. "The discovery was very exciting, because we had our brightest ever event right after all three outriggers were online," said Amanda Cook, a Banting postdoctoral researcher at McGill University and a U of T alum who led the paper describing RBFLOAT. "Immediately, even though it was a Sunday afternoon, a bunch of us piled into a Zoom room and started hacking away at the research, hoping to get follow-up observations on source as quickly as possible."
