The next story is: Xcel settles Marshall Fire lawsuit just before trial begins in Boulder - Colorado Public Radio. Updated at 2:43 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 24, 2025. Xcel Energy and two telecom companies have agreed to a $640 million settlement with plaintiffs on the eve of the Marshall Fire trial. The “agreement in principle” was announced by the utility company on Wednesday. It is not yet final and must still be approved by the individual plaintiffs in the trial. The exact terms of the settlement are confidential, according to the law firm Singleton Schreiber, which represented several plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The state’s largest utility said it expects to pay around $640 million to thousands of plaintiffs in the case, which includes insurers, Boulder County and residents. The company expects around $350 million of those payments to be covered by its insurance policies, and that none of the costs will be borne by customers. The two telecom companies will also contribute to the settlement payments. Several attorneys for the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached for comment. District Court Judge Christopher Clayton Zenisek wrote in an order that both sides must provide a written update about the settlement within 30 days. Lawyers will meet again on November 5 to discuss the agreement. As part of the settlement, Xcel maintains that its equipment did not cause the Marshall Fire, and does not admit to any negligence or fault. “In resolving all liability from the claims, this settlement reinforces our longstanding commitment to supporting the communities we serve,” said Bob Frenzel, chairman, president and CEO of Xcel Energy. Tawnya Somauroo, a Louisville resident who lost her home in the Marshall Fire, said the immediate news of the settlement left more questions than answers. On Wednesday afternoon, she was still waiting for her lawyers to provide more details about the settlement terms. Somauroo mainly hopes settlement dollars will help continue to restitch the neighborhoods impacted by the disaster. By the time her family joined the case, they had already had to move five times due to the fire, which she said caused enormous mental strain and ongoing therapy bills. And even though Somauroo's family has managed to rebuild, she knows other plaintiffs in the case weren't so lucky. "I know at least three families in my neighborhood would rebuild if they had enough money. And hoping that I just get that community back. I would settle for that right now," Somaruoo said. This is not the first time Xcel’s parent company has settled wildfire-related litigation. Xcel estimates it will pay around $290 million in claims and settlements for its role in Texas’ largest wildfire, the 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire. The company has settled several lawsuits related to that fire, but it denies it acted negligently. The company did acknowledge though “that its facilities appear to have been involved in an ignition” of that fire. Some of those payments will also be covered by the company’s insurance. The trial, which was slated to last until late November, would have focused on whether Xcel and two telecom companies should be held liable for sparking one of the fires that eventually merged into the Marshall Fire. Jury selection was slated to begin Thursday in Boulder County District Court. If Xcel had been found liable, it could have exposed the company to hundreds of millions, if not more than a billion dollars, in damages. Determining those damages, however, would have been decided in future trials, and could have stretched on for years. A final settlement, if approved, will significantly shorten that timeline, and shrink the company’s financial risk. In recent years, Western utility companies have faced enormous bills in response to wildfire-related settlements or after
