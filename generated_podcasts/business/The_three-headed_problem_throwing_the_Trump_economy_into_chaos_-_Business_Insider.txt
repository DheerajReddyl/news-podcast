The next story is: The three-headed problem throwing the Trump economy into chaos - Business Insider. There's a rule of thumb in apartment hunting: People want something affordable, spacious, and convenient, but in the end, they can only get two of the three. Big and cheap? Prepare for a long commute. Less expensive and downtown? Enjoy your shoebox. Spacious and well-located? Get ready to shell out big bucks. It's a classic "trilemma," or an impossible triangle: No matter how you, well, triangulate it, one priority has to go if the other two remain. President Donald Trump — and the American people along with him — are in the midst of an economic trilemma that is much more serious than deciding whether you should live in the center of town or way out in the suburbs. The president wants to boost US manufacturing, cut down on immigration, and keep prices down all at once. Those work fine as goals on their own, or even in pairs, but many economists and trade experts say he can't accomplish all three at once. Sure, you can try to open more factories to build cheap stuff or even expensive, high-tech goods, but cutting off the flow of workers from abroad makes staffing those factories challenging. You may be able to severely curb immigration and make your best efforts at building in the US via tariffs, but that will likely push prices up. Companies could continue to produce less expensive products abroad, especially if trade policy were eased, which would keep consumers happy. The problem is that there are always tradeoffs. It's Trump's economic war vs. his culture war vs. the pocketbooks of everyday Americans. If there has been one throughline to the president's economic agenda, it's his desire to rebuild American manufacturing and get companies to make things here. Firms can still import to the US, but they'll have to pay a price to do so, in the form of tariffs. But the way the administration is treating some businesses that are making efforts to do what Trump wants is getting in the president's own way. "He's asking for these countries to invest in the United States, oftentimes holding the threat of tariffs over their head in order to encourage them to invest in the United States. But at the same time, there's a series of things that are happening that are making the US a less attractive place to invest," says Didi Caldwell, the founder and owner of Global Location Strategies, a firm that specializes in site selection for manufacturing and industrial companies. It's Trump's economic war vs. his culture war vs. the pocketbooks of everyday Americans. The most glaring deterrent for foreign companies looking to move some operations to America's shores is Trump's immigration crackdown. In early September, federal law enforcement conducted an immigration raid on a $7.6 billion Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia, arresting and detaining 475 workers, most of whom were South Korean nationals. The company said the raid would delay the plant's startup date by two to three months, in the immediate term, but the incident has sparked broader concerns about foreign investment. It's true that foreign companies building and investing in the US should follow the law on immigration and otherwise. It's also true that the threat of showy, seemingly random crackdowns has spooked them. "There's this gray area, and generally folks look the other way, but you don't look the other way when you're conducting very public immigration raids," says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "That gets to where the conflict is. Trump is weird. He actually is not totally against at
