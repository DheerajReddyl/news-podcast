Our next story is titled: UK drug price rises 'necessary', says Lord Patrick Vallance - BBC. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for lower drug prices in the UK. The UK government has said it will not raise drug prices for the next five years. The government has also announced a Â£1bn investment in research and development. The move is seen as a boost to the UK economy, which has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. The announcement follows a similar move in the U.S., where drug prices have risen by as much as 40% in the last decade. And that concludes this report.
